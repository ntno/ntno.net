# mkdocs-terminal
Winter 2021 - Present

[MkDocs] is a framework for creating documentation websites from markdown files.  Custom themes can be applied to give sites a unique style.  I created the theme for this portfolio site using [terminal.css].  See [squidfunk's material theme]{target=_blank, title="view site with mkdocs-material theme"} for comparison.

In January of 2023 I packaged my work as an open source MkDocs theme called [Terminal for MkDocs].  Publishing the theme as a third party open source package allows other MkDocs users to easily install and apply `terminal.css` styling to their own websites.  

In addition to the general styling of `terminal.css`,  
[Terminal for MkDocs] includes the following new features:  

- [Tile Grid](https://ntno.github.io/mkdocs-terminal/tile-grid/)
- [Section Indexes](https://ntno.github.io/mkdocs-terminal/navigation/section-indexes/)

As of January 2025 the project has over 200 stars on GitHub and one accepted open source contribution.
