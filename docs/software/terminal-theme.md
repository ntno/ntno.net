# mkdocs-terminal
Winter 2021 - Present

[MkDocs] is a framework for creating documentation websites from markdown files.  Custom themes can be applied to give sites a unique style.  I created the theme for this portfolio site using [Gioni06's terminal.css].  See [squidfunk's material theme]{target=_blank, title="view site with mkdocs-material theme"} for comparison.

In January of 2023 I packaged my work as an open source MkDocs theme called "Terminal for MkDocs."  Publishing the theme as a third party open source package allows other MkDocs users to easily install and apply `terminal.css` styling to their own websites.  

In addition to `terminal.css` styling, [Terminal for MkDocs] includes the following new features:  

- [Tile Grid](https://ntno.github.io/mkdocs-terminal/tile-grid/)
- [Section Indexes](https://ntno.github.io/mkdocs-terminal/navigation/section-indexes/)

As of January 2025 the project has over 200 stars on GitHub and one accepted open source contribution.

## In The Wild

As of January 2025, Terminal for MkDocs is listed as a dependency of one hundred repositories on GitHub.  Out of those one hundred I selected the below projects to share on this personal site.  The sites were selected for their use of theme customizations (palette, font, CSS overrides) and use of embedded images.  Some are personal websites like this one; others are user documentation for software or hardware projects.  

*I do not endorse any of the information, products, or services in the linked sites; they are shared merely to provide an example of how Terminal for MkDocs is being leveraged by real users.  Site preview images were captured 01/19/25.*
