# `mkdocs-terminal` Theme
Winter 2021 - Present

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){target=_blank} is a framework for creating documentation websites from markdown files.  Custom themes can be applied to give sites a unique style.  I created the theme for this portfolio site using [terminal.css](https://github.com/Gioni06/terminal.css){target=_blank}.  See [squidfunk's material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/){target=_blank, title="view example site"} for theme comparison.

## Open Source
In January of 2023 I created an open source MkDocs theme for `terminal.css` called [Terminal for MkDocs](https://github.com/ntno/mkdocs-terminal){target="_blank"}.  This allows MkDocs users to easily install and apply the theme to their own site via pip package.  

In addition to the general styling of `terminal.css`, the `mkdocs-terminal` MkDocs theme includes the following new features:  

- [Section Indexes](https://ntno.github.io/mkdocs-terminal/navigation/section-indexes/){target=_blank}
- [Tile Grid](https://ntno.github.io/mkdocs-terminal/tile-grid/){target=_blank}
