# MkDocs `terminal.css` Theme
Winter 2021

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){target=_blank} is a framework for creating documentation websites from markdown files.  Custom themes can be applied to give sites a unique style.  I created the theme for this portfolio site using [terminal.css](https://github.com/Gioni06/terminal.css){target=_blank}.  See [squidfunk's material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/){target=_blank, title="view example site"} for theme comparison.

## Open Source
I intend to eventually package this theme as an external [MkDocs theme](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes){target=_blank}.  This would make the theme installable as a pip package.  

For now, the theme can be viewed within my portfolio site repo here: [ntno/ntno.net/custom_theme](https://github.com/ntno/ntno.net/tree/main/custom_theme){target=_blank}
