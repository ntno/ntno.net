**hello, world**

When I first entered college I was not sure what I wanted to study.  I remember being interested in psychology, classical history, and urban planning, but computer science was not at the front of my mind.  I ended up taking an introductory course in the subject because the description mentioned something about making art.  It turned out that we would be making sketches in [Processing](https://processing.org/){target=_blank} as we learned the basics of computer programming.  

Our first assignment was to create a representational work using all of Processing's primitive drawing functions (ellipse, line, rectangle, etc.) at least once.
